\section{Weights}

\begin{prb}[Weights]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A \emph{weight} is an additive homogeneous function $\f:M^+\to[0,\infty]$ in the sense that
\[\f(x+y)=\f(x)+\f(y),\qquad\f(tx)=t\f(x),\qquad x,y\in M^+,\ t\ge0,\]
where we use the convention $0\cdot\infty=0$.
Define
\[\fN_\f:=\{x\in M:\f(x^*x)<\infty\},\qquad\fA_\f:=\fN_\f^*\cap\fN_\f,\qquad\fM_\f:=\fN_\f^*\fN_\f.\]
It follows easily that $\fN_\f$ is a left ideal of $M$ equipped with a sesqui-linear form $\<x,y\>:=\f(y^*x)$ for $x,y\in\fN_\f$, $\fA_\f$ is a hereditary $*$-subalgebra of $M$, and $\fM_\f$ is a hereditary $*$-subalgebra of $M$ equipped with a linear functional which extends $\f$ by the polarization identity.

Let $\f$ be a weight on $M$.
We say $\f$ is \emph{faithful} if $\f(x)=0$ implies $x=0$ for $x\in M^+$, \emph{semi-finite} if $\fM_\f$or equivalently $\fN_\f$ is $\sigma$-weakly dense in $M$, and \emph{normal} if it is written as the supremum of some set of normal positive linear functionals.
\begin{parts}
\item Every von Neumann algebra admits a faithful semi-finite normal weight.
\item $\fM_\f^+=\{x^*x:x\in\fN_\f\}$ and $\fM_\f=\{y^*x:x,y\in\fN_\f\}$.
%\item opposite weight
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(a)
Let $\{\omega_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a maximal family of normal states on $M$ such that the support projections $p_i:=s(\omega_i)$ are mutually orthogonal, taken with the Zorn lemma.
From the maximality, we have the $\sigma$-strong$^*$ limit $\sum_ip_i=1$.
Define a weight $\f:M^+\to[0,\infty]$ by
\[\f(x):=\sum_i\omega_i(x),\qquad x\in M^+.\]
It is faithful since $\f(x^*x)=0$ means $\omega_i(x^*x)=0$ for all $i$, which implies $xp_i=0$ and
\[\<x\xi,\xi\>=\<\sum_ip_i\xi,x^*\xi\>=\sum_i\<p_i\xi,x^*\xi\>=\sum_i\<xp_i\xi,\xi\>=0.\]
It is semi-finite since an increasing net $p_J:=\sum_{i\in J}p_i\in\fM_\f$ converges to the unit, where $J$ runs through all finite subsets of $I$.
It is normal by definition.

(b)
Let $z:=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^*x_i\in\fM_\f^+$ for some $x_i,y_i\in\fN_\f$.
The polarization writes
\[z=\frac14\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{k=0}^3i^k|x_i+i^ky_i|^2\]
so it follows from $z^*=z$ that
\[z=\frac12\sum_{i=1}^n(|x_i+y_i|^2-|x_i-y_i|^2)\le\frac12\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i+y_i|^2.\]
Since $\f(z)<\infty$ by $x_i+y_i\in\fN_\f$, if $x:=z^{\frac12}\in\fN_\f$, then $z=x^*x$.

Let $z:=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^*x_i\in\fM_\f$ for some $x_i,y_i\in\fM_\f$.
Let $x:=(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^*x_i)^{\frac12}\in\fN_\f$.
Since $x_i^*x_i\le x^2$, we have $v_i\in M$ such that $x_i=v_ix$.
If we let $y:=\sum_{i=1}^nv_i^*y_i\in\fN_\f$, then
\[z=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^*x_i=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^*v_ix=\Bigr(\sum_{i=1}^nv_i^*y_i\Bigr)^*x=y^*x.\qedhere\]
\end{pf}



\begin{prb}[Semi-cyclic representations]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A \emph{semi-cyclic representation} is a representation $\pi:M\to B(H)$ together with a densely defined and densely ranged left $M$-linear operator $\Lambda:\dom\Lambda\subset M\to H$.
We say that a representation of $M$ is \emph{semi-cyclic} if it admits such an operator $\Lambda$.
Note that it implies that a semi-cyclic representation is always non-degenerate.
Define
\begin{align*}
\cF_\Lambda:=\{\omega\in M_*^+:\omega(x^*x)\le\|\Lambda(x)\|^2,\ x\in\dom\Lambda\},\\
\cG_\Lambda:=\{\omega\in M_*^+:\omega(x^*x)<\|\Lambda(x)\|^2,\ x\in\dom\Lambda\}.
\end{align*}
\begin{parts}
\item 
\item If $(\pi,\Lambda)$ is normal and a semi-finite normal weight $\f$ on $M$ satisfies that $\f(x^*x)=0$ whenever $\Lambda(x)=0$ for $x\in\dom\Lambda$, then there is a positive self-adjoint operator $h$ affiliated with $\pi(M)'$ such that $\ran\Lambda\subset\dom h$ and $\f(x^*x)=\<h\Lambda(x),\Lambda(x)\>$.
\item Let $\hat\cF_\Lambda$ be the set of all semi-finite normal weights $\f$ such that $\f(x^*x)\le\|\Lambda(x)\|^2$ for $x\in\dom\Lambda$. Then, the vector functional map $(\pi(M)')^+_1\to\hat\cF_\Lambda:h\mapsto\f_h$ defined such that $\f_h(x^*x):=\<h\Lambda(x),\Lambda(x)\>$ for $x\in\dom\Lambda$ is bijective.
The operator $h$ is called the \emph{Radon-Nikodym derivative} of $\f_h\in\cF_\Lambda$ in the commutant with respect to $\Lambda$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(b)
Using the semi-finiteness of $\f$, take a net $e_i$ in $\fN_\f$ such that $e_i\uparrow1$, and let $\f_i$ be a normal positive linear functional on $M$ defined such that $\f_i(x^*x):=\f(e_ix^*xe_i)$ for $x\in M$.
For each fixed $y\in\dom\Lambda$ and $i$, we have $\ran\Lambda\subset H\to\C:\Lambda(x)\mapsto\f_i(y^*x)$ which is well-defined and bounded linear functional on $H$ by the assumption and
\[|\f_i(y^*x)|^2\lesssim|\f_i(y^*y)||\f_i(x^*x)|\lesssim\|\Lambda(y)\|^2\|\Lambda(x)\|^2,\qquad x\in\dom\Lambda.\]


(If $\f_i$ is not contained in the weakly closed convex cone $\R^+\cF_\Lambda$, then there is $x\in M^+$ such that $\f_i(x)\ne0$ and $\omega(x)=0$ for any $\omega\in\cF_\Lambda$.
normality of $\Lambda$ and the assumption imply $|\f_i(x^*x)|\lesssim\|\Lambda(x)\|^2$.
positive Hahn-Banachh separation?)


By the Riesz representation theorem, we can define $h_i\in\pi(M)'$ such that $\f_i(x^*x)=\<h_i\Lambda(x),\Lambda(x)\>$ for $x\in\dom\Lambda$.
\end{pf}

Justification of positive self-adjoint operators by the limit of increasing positive bounded operators?



\begin{prb}[Normal semi-cyclic representations]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A semi-cyclic representation $(\pi,\Lambda)$ of $M$ is called \emph{normal} if $\pi$ is normal and $\Lambda$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed.

For a weight $\f$ on $M$, on the Hilbert space $H_\f$ constructed by separation and completion of the sesqui-linear form on $\fN_\f$, define $\pi_\f:M\to B(H_\f)$ by the left multiplication and $\Lambda_\f:\dom\Lambda_\f\subset H_\f\to H_\f$ as the canonical map with $\dom\Lambda_\f:=\fN_\f$.
Then, $(\pi_\f,\Lambda_\f)$ is clearly a semi-cyclic representation, called the \emph{Gelfand-Naimark-Segal representation} of $\f$.
Conversely, for a semi-cyclic representation $(\pi,\Lambda)$ of $M$ on a Hilbert space $H$, define $\f_\Lambda:=\sup\{\omega:\omega\in\cF_\Lambda\}$.
Then, $\f_\Lambda$ is clearly a weight.
\begin{parts}
\item If $\f$ is normal, then $(\pi_\f,\Lambda_\f)$ is normal, and $\f=\f_{\Lambda_\f}$.
\item If $(\pi,\Lambda)$ is normal, then $\f_\Lambda$ is normal, and there exists a unitary operator $u:H\to H_{\f_\Lambda}$ satisfying $\pi_{\f_\Lambda}=(\Ad u)\pi$ and $\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}=u\Lambda$.
\item For a normal $\f$, $\f$ is faithful if and only if $\Lambda_\f$ is injective, and $\f$ is semi-finite if and only if $\Lambda_\f$ is $\sigma$-weakly densely defined.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(a)
We first show $\pi_\f$ is normal.
The proof is almost same as the normality of cyclic representation associated to normal states.
Consider the adjoint $\pi_\f^*:B(H)_*\to M^*$.
For a normal state $\omega\in B(H)_*$ of the form $\omega=\omega_{\Lambda_\f(x)}$ for some $x\in\fN_\f$, since
\[\pi_\f^*(\omega)(y)=\omega_{\Lambda_\f(x)}(\pi_\f(y))=\<\pi_\f(y)\Lambda_\f(x),\Lambda_\f(x)\>=\f(x^*yx),\qquad y\in M,\]
and since $\f$ is order continuous, we can see that $\pi_\f^*(\omega)$ is also order continuous, which means that it is contained in $M_*$.
Because the image of $\Lambda_\f$ is dense, the linear span of states of the form $\omega_{\Lambda_\f(x)}$ with $x\in\fN_\f$ is norm-dense in $B(H)_*$ by the inequality
\[\|\omega_\xi-\omega_\eta\|\le\|\xi-\eta\|\|\xi+\eta\|,\qquad\xi,\eta\in H.\]
Since $M_*$ is norm-closed $M^*$, so $\pi_\f^*$ maps normal states of $B(H)$ to normal states $M_*$.

Next, we show $\Lambda_\f$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed.
Let $\Gamma(\Lambda_\f):=\{(x,\Lambda_\f(x)):x\in\fN_\f\}\subset M\times H$ be the graph of $\Lambda_\f$.
Note that for closedness of convex subsets of $M\times H$ we do not have to distinguish $\sigma$-weak topology from $\sigma$-strong$^*$ topology on $M$ and weak topology from norm topology on $H$.
Suppose a net $x_i\in\fN_\f$ satisfies $x_i\to x$ $\sigma$-strongly$^*$ in $M$ and $\Lambda_\f(x_i)\to\xi$ stronlgy in $H$.
Since $\f$ is normal, we have
\[\f=\sup_{\omega\in\cF_\f}\omega,\qquad\cF_\f:=\cF_{\Lambda_\f}=\{\omega\in M_*^+:\omega\le\f\}.\]
Then, it follows that $x\in\fN_\f$ from
\[\f(x^*x)=\sup_{\omega\in\cF_\f}\omega(x^*x)=\sup_{\omega\in\cF_\f}\lim_i\omega(x_i^*x_i)\le\lim_i\f(x_i^*x_i)=\lim_i\|\Lambda_\f(x_i)\|^2=\|\xi\|^2<\infty.\]
For fixed $\e>0$ and any $y\in\fN_\f$, if we take $\omega\in\cF_\f$ such that $\omega(y^*y)>\f(y^*y)-\e$ and let $h\in(M')_1^+$ be the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\omega$ with respect to $\f$ in the commutant, then
\begin{align*}
\|h\Lambda(y)-\Lambda(y)\|^2
&=\<h^2\Lambda(y),\Lambda(y)\>-2\<h\Lambda(y),\Lambda(y)\>+\<\Lambda(y),\Lambda(y)\>\\
&\le-\<h\Lambda(y),\Lambda(y)\>+\<\Lambda(y),\Lambda(y)\>\\
&=-\omega(y^*y)+\f(y^*y)<\e
\end{align*}
and the convergence $\Lambda(x_i)\to\xi$ in norm imply
\[\<\xi-\Lambda_\f(x),\Lambda_\f(y)\>\approx\<\xi-\Lambda_\f(x),h\Lambda_\f(y)\>\approx\<\Lambda(x_i)-\Lambda(x),h\Lambda(y)\>=\omega(y^*(x_i-x)),\qquad\e\to0,\]
and the $\sigma$-weak convergence $x_i\to x$ implies $\omega(y^*(x_i-x))\to0$, we can conclude that $\<\xi-\Lambda_\f(x),\Lambda_\f(y)\>$ vanishes for all $y\in\fN_\f$.
Since $\Lambda_\f$ has dense image, we finally have $\xi=\Lambda_\f(x)$.
Therefore, the graph of $\Lambda_\f$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed.

For $\omega\in M_*^+$, we have $\omega\le\f$ if and only if $\omega(x^*x)\le\f(x^*x)=\|\Lambda_\f(x)\|^2$ for $x\in\dom\Lambda_\f$, which means that $\cF_\f=\cF_{\Lambda_\f}$ and $\f=\f_{\Lambda_\f}$.

(b)
The weight $\f_\Lambda$ is obviously normal by definition.
Let $x\in\dom\Lambda$.
Then, we have
\[\f_\Lambda(x^*x)=\sup_{\omega\in\cF_\Lambda}\omega(x^*x)\le\|\Lambda(x)\|^2\]
by definition of $\f_\Lambda$ and $\cF_\Lambda$, so we get $x\in\fN_{\f_\Lambda}=\dom\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}$ and $\|\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(x)\|\le\|\Lambda(x)\|$.
Conversely, let $x\in\dom\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}$.
We have $\f_\Lambda(x^*x)=\|\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(x)\|^2<\infty$.
We claim that if $\f_\Lambda(x^*x)\le1$, then $x\in\dom\Lambda$ and $\|\Lambda(x)\|^2\le1$.
As a corollary, the inequality $\|\Lambda(x)\|\le\|\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(x)\|$ follows by scaling from this claim.

We prove the claim.
Since the graph of $\Lambda$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed by assumption, and since the projection $\dom\Lambda\times H_1\to\dom\Lambda$ is a closed map due to the tube lemma and the weak compactness of $H_1$, the image
\[\{y:\|\Lambda(y)\|\le1,\ y\in\dom\Lambda\}\subset M\]
of the graph of $\Lambda$ under this projection is $\sigma$-weakly closed.
Since the positive part of this set is also $\sigma$-weakly closed and the square root is strongly continuous, if we temporarily consider a sufficiently large representation of $M$ in which every normal state is a vector state so that a strong and $\sigma$-strong topology coincide on $M$, we can conclude that the inverse image under the square root
\[C:=\{y^*y:\|\Lambda(y)\|\le1,\ y\in\dom\Lambda\}\subset M\]
is $\sigma$-weakly closed.
Note that $C$ is also convex, and $\omega\in M_*^+$ is contained in $\cF_\Lambda$ if and only if
\[\sup_{y^*y\in C}\omega(y^*y)\le1.\]

If $x^*x\notin C$, then, by the Hahn-Banach separation, there is $\omega\in M_*^{sa}$ such that
\[\sup_{y^*y\in C}\omega(y^*y)\le1<\omega(x^*x),\]
and since we may assume $\omega$ is positive(How can we see $\omega(1)=\|\omega\|$?), we have $\omega\in\cF_\Lambda$.
Thus, we have $\omega(x^*x)\le\f_\Lambda(x^*x)\le1$ by definition of $\f_\Lambda$, which leads a contradiction, so we get $x^*x\in C$.
Now there is $y\in\dom\Lambda$ satisfying $x^*x=y^*y$ so that there is $v\in M$ with $x=vy$, and because $\dom\Lambda$ is a left ideal of $M$, we finally have $x\in\dom\Lambda$, and $x^*x\in C$ says that $\|\Lambda(x)\|\le1$, hence the claim follows.

In conclusion, we have $\dom\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}=\dom\Lambda$ and $\|\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(x)\|=\|\Lambda(x)\|$ on it.
Since the images of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}$ are dense in $H$ and $H_{\f_\Lambda}$ respectively, we can define the unitary $u:H\to H_{\f_\Lambda}$ such that $u\Lambda(y):=\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(y)$, and hence that $u\pi(x)u^*=\pi_{\f_\Lambda}(x)$ because
\[u^*\pi_{\f_\Lambda}(x)u\Lambda(y)=u^*\pi_{\f_\Lambda}(x)\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(y)=u^*\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}(xy)=\Lambda(xy)=\pi(x)\Lambda(y),\]
for $x,y\in\dom\Lambda_{\f_\Lambda}$.

\begin{prb}[Countability of von Neumann algebras]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A projection $p\in M$ is called \emph{countably decomposable} if mutually orthogonal nonzero projections majorized by $p$ are at most countable, and we say $M$ is \emph{countably decomposable} if the identity is.

\begin{parts}
\item $M$ is countably decomposable if and only if it admits a faithful normal state.
\item $M$ is countably decomposable if and only if $M_1$ is metrizable in the $\sigma$-strong topology.
\item $M$ has separable predual if and only if it is countably decomposable and countably generated.
\item $M$ has separable predual if and only if it faithfully acts on a separable Hilbert space.
\item $M$ has separable predual if and only if $M_1$ is metrizable in the $\sigma$-weak topology.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
\end{pf}


\begin{prb}[Normal weights]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra, and $\f$ be a weight on $M$.
\begin{parts}
\item If $\f$ is order continuous, then it is $\sigma$-weakly lower semi-continuous.
\item If $\f$ is $\sigma$-weakly lower semi-continuous, then it is normal.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
Since the product topology of the $\sigma$-weak topology on $\fN_\f$ and the weak topology on $H$ is the weak$^*$ topology on the dual Banach space $(M_*\oplus_1H)^*\cong M\oplus_\infty H$, it suffices to show the graph is closed in this weak$^*$ topology.
In the spirit of the Krein-S\v mulian theorem, consider the unit ball
\[\Gamma(\Lambda_\f)_1=\{(x,\Lambda_\f(x)):x\in\fN_\f,\ \|x\|\le1,\ \|\Lambda_\f(x)\|\le1\},\]
which is also convex.

\section{Hilbert algebras}

\begin{prb}[Left and right Hilbert algebras]
A \emph{left Hilbert algebra} is a complex inner product space $A$ which is a $*$-algebra such that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the left multiplication defines a non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $L_0:A\subset H\to B(H)$,
\item the involution defines a closable anti-linear operator $S_0:A\subset H\to H$,
\end{enumerate}
where $H$ is the completion of $A$.
The involution of a left Hilbert algebra is denoted by $\xi\mapsto\xi^\sharp$.

For $\eta\in H$, define $R(\eta):A\subset H\to H$ and $F\eta:A\subset H\to\C$ such that
\[R(\eta)\xi:=L_0(\xi)\eta,\quad F\eta(\xi)=\<\eta,S_0\xi\>,\qquad\xi\in A.\]
If we introduce
\[\dom R:=\{\eta\in H:R(\eta)\text{ is bounded}\},\qquad\dom F:=\{\eta\in H:F\eta\text{ is bounded}\},\]
we can let $R:\dom R\subset H\to B(H)$ and $F:\dom F\subset H\to H$ be a densely defined anti-homomorphism and a densely defined anti-linear operator.
Let $A':=\dom R\cap\dom F$.
We will show $A'$ is dense in $H$.

Symmetrically for $\xi\in H$, after verifying $A'$ is dense in $H$, we can define $L(\xi):A'\subset H\to H$ and $S\xi:A'\subset H\to\C$ such that
\[L(\xi)\eta:=R(\eta)\xi,\quad S\xi(\eta)=\<\xi,F\eta\>,\qquad\eta\in A',\]
and by introducing
\[\dom L:=\{\xi\in H:L(\xi)\text{ is bounded}\},\qquad\dom S:=\{\xi\in H:S\xi\text{ is bounded}\},\]
we recognize $L:\dom L\subset H\to B(H)$ and $S:\dom S\subset H\to H$ as a densely defined homomorphism and a densely defined anti-linear operator which densely extend $L_0$ and $S_0$.
Let $A'':=\dom L\cap\dom S$.
If $A=A''$, then we say $A$ is \emph{full}.
\begin{parts}
\item $A'$ is a $*$-algebra with the multiplication $(\eta,\zeta)\mapsto\eta\zeta:=R(\zeta)\eta$ and the involution $\eta\mapsto\eta^\flat:=F\eta$.
\item $A'$ is a right Hilbert algebra.
\item $L,S,R$ and $F$ are injective and closed.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(a)
The well-definedness of the multiplication and the involution on $A'$ follows clearly by combining from (i) to (iv) in the below.
The fact that the multiplication and the involution are really multiplication and involution on $A'$ comes from (iv) and (i), and their compatibility follows from (iii).

(i)
We have $FF\eta=\eta$ in $H$ for $\eta\in \dom F$ by
\[FF\eta(\xi)=\<F\eta,S\xi\>=\<SS\xi,\eta\>=\<\xi^{\sharp\sharp},\eta\>=\<\xi,\eta\>,\qquad\xi\in A.\]
In particular, if $\eta\in\dom F$, then $F\eta\in\dom F$.

(ii)
We have $R(F\eta)=R(\eta)^*$ on $A$ for $\eta\in\dom F$ by
\begin{align*}
\<R(F\eta)\xi,\xi\>
&=\<L(\xi)F\eta,\xi\>
=\<F\eta,L(\xi)^*\xi\>
=\<SL(\xi)^*\xi,\eta\>
=\<(\xi^\sharp\xi)^\sharp,\eta\>\\
&=\<\xi^\sharp\xi,\eta\>
=\<L(\xi)^*\xi,\eta\>
=\<\xi,L(\xi)\eta\>
=\<\xi,R(\eta)\xi\>
=\<R(\eta)^*\xi,\xi\>
,\qquad\xi\in A.
\end{align*}
In particular, if $\eta\in\dom F$, then $F\eta\in\dom R$, and $R(\eta)$ is a closed densely defined operator.

(iii)
We have $F(R(\eta)^*\zeta)=R(\zeta)^*\eta$ in $H$ for $\eta,\zeta\in\dom R$ by
\begin{align*}
\<F(R(\eta)^*\zeta),\xi\>
&=\<S\xi,R(\eta)^*\zeta\>
=\<R(\eta)S\xi,\zeta\>
=\<L(S\xi)\eta,\zeta\>
=\<L(\xi)^*\eta,\zeta\>\\
&=\<\eta,L(\xi)\zeta\>
=\<\eta,R(\zeta)\xi\>
=\<R(\zeta)^*\eta,\xi\>
,\qquad\xi\in A.
\end{align*}
In particular, if $\eta,\zeta\in\dom R$, then $F(\eta)^*\zeta\in\dom F$.

(iv)
We have $R(R(\eta)^*\zeta)=R(\eta)^*R(\zeta)$ on $A$ for $\eta\in\dom R$ and $\zeta\in H$ by
\begin{align*}
\<R(R(\eta)^*\zeta)\xi,\xi\>
&=\<L(\xi)R(\eta)^*\zeta,\xi\>
=\<\zeta,R(\eta)L(\xi)^*\xi\>
=\<\zeta,L(L(\xi)^*\xi)\eta\>\\
&=\<\zeta,L(\xi^\sharp\xi)\eta\>
=\<\zeta,L(\xi)^*L(\xi)\eta\>
=\<L(\xi)\zeta,L(\xi)\eta\>\\
&=\<R(\zeta)\xi,R(\eta)\xi\>
=\<R(\eta)^*R(\zeta)\xi,\xi\>
,\qquad\xi\in A.
\end{align*}
In particular, if $\eta,\zeta\in\dom R$, then $F(\eta)^*\zeta\in\dom R$.

(b)
Since $F$ has a densely defined adjoint $S$, it is closable, so we only need to show $R$ is non-degenerate.
For $\dom F$ is dense in $H$ by the closability of $S$, it suffices to verify the inclusion $\dom F\subset\bar{A'^2}$ in order for density of $R(A')H$ in $H$.
We fix $\eta\in\dom F$ and claim it is approximated by elements of $A'^2$.
Since $R(\eta)$ is closed and densely defined by (ii) in the part (a), we can write down the polar decomposition
\[R(\eta)=vh=kv,\qquad h:=|R(\eta)|,\quad k:=|R(\eta)^*|.\]
To control the unboundedness of $R(\eta)$, we introduce $f\in C_c((0,\infty))^+$ to cutoff $R(\eta)$.
Let $\acute f(t):=tf(t)$ and $\grave f(t):=t^{-1}f(t)$.
Now we have $f(k)\in\ran R$ and $f(k)\eta\in\dom R$ because we have on $A$ that
\[f(k)=f(vhv^*)=vf(h)v^*=v\grave f(h)hv^*=v\grave f(h)R(F\eta)=R\left(v\grave f(h)F\eta\right)\]
and
\[R(f(k)\eta)=f(k)R(\eta)=f(k)kv=\acute f(k)v,\]
which are bounded and extended to $H$.
Applying the above for $f^{\frac13}\in C_c((0,\infty))$, 
\[f(k)\eta=(f(k)^{\frac13})^3\eta\in(\ran R)^*(\ran R)(\ran R)^*\dom R.\]
Because $(\ran R)^*\dom R\subset A'$ and $(\ran R)^*(\ran R)\subset R(A')$ by (iii) and (iv) in the part (a), we have $f(k)\eta\in A'^2$.
If we consider a non-decreasing net $e_i$ in $C_c((0,\infty))$ such that $e_i\uparrow1_{(0,\infty)}$, then we get
\[e_i(k)\eta\to1_{(0,\infty)}(k)\eta=s(k)\eta=s_l(R(\eta))\eta=\eta\in\bar{A'^2},\]
where the last equality is due to $\eta\in\bar{L(A)\eta}=\bar{R(\eta)A}$ by the non-degeneracy of $L$.

(c)
We have
\[L_0^*(\omega_{\eta,\zeta})=R(\eta)^*\zeta,\qquad\eta\in\dom R,\ \zeta\in H.\]

Is $\omega_{\dom R,H}$ weakly dense in $M_*$?
Is $(\ran R)H$ dense in $H$?
Yes!

\item For a full left Hilbert algebra $A\subset H$ such that $\bar A=H$ and $L(A)''=M$, if we define $\Lambda:\dom\Lambda\subset M\to H$ as the inverse of $L:\dom L\subset H\to M$, then $\Lambda$ is a densely defined $\sigma$-weakly closed left $M$-linear operator of dense image such that $A=\Lambda((\dom\Lambda)^*\cap(\dom\Lambda))$.
\item For a densely defined $\sigma$-weakly closed left $M$-linear operator $\Lambda:\dom\Lambda\subset M\to H$ of dense image, if we define $A:=\Lambda((\dom\Lambda)^*\cap(\dom\Lambda))$, then $A$ is a natural full left Hilbert algebra such that $\bar A=H$ and $L(A)''=M$ such that $\Lambda$ is the inverse of $L$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(a)
The domain and image of $\Lambda$ is dense in $M$ and $H$ because the image and domain of $L$ is dense in $M$ and $H$.
The graph of the $\Lambda$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed since its inverse $L$ is $\sigma$-weakly closed.
To check the left $M$-linearity, let $x\in M$ and $\xi\in\dom L$.
Since $\dom\Lambda$ is a $\sigma$-weakly dense $*$-subalgebra of $M$, it admits an approximate unit $e_i\in(\dom\Lambda)_1^+$ with $e_i\to1$ $\sigma$-strongly$^*$.
Because $\dom\Lambda$ is hereditary, we have a net $e_ixe_i\in\dom\Lambda$ satisfying $e_ixe_i\to x$ $\sigma$-strongly$^*$.
Then, we have $e_ixe_i\xi\to x\xi$ and a $\sigma$-weak limit
\[L(e_ixe_i\xi)=L(L(\Lambda(e_ixe_i))\xi)=L(\Lambda(e_ixe_i)\xi)=L(\Lambda(e_ixe_i))L(\xi)=e_ixe_iL(\xi)\to xL(\xi),\]
so the closedness of $L$ implies that $L(x\xi)=xL(\xi)$.

\section{Standard forms}


\begin{prb}[Standard forms]
For a subset $P$ of a complex vector space $H$, the \emph{dual cone} is the closed convex cone $P^\circ:=\{\eta\in H:\<\xi,\eta\>\ge0,\ \xi\in P\}$, and we say $P$ is a \emph{self-dual cone} if $P=P^\circ$.
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A \emph{standard form} $(M,H,J,P)$ of $M$ is a faithful unital normal representation $M\subset B(H)$ together with an anti-linear isometric involution $J:H\to H$ and a self-dual cone $P\subset H$ satisfying the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $JMJ=M'$,
\item $z'=z^*$ for $z\in Z(M)$,
\item $J\xi=\xi$ for $\xi\in P$,
\item $xx'P\subset P$ for $x\in M$,
\end{enumerate}
where $x':=JxJ\in M'$ for $x\in M$.
\begin{parts}
\item For projections $p\in M$ and $q:=pp'=p'p\in B(H)$ in a standard form, then $q\ne0$ if and only if $p\ne0$, and $(qMq,qH,qJq,qP)$ is also a standard form.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
From $(JpJ)\in M'$, we have $pq=q=qp$ and $pxq=qxq=qxp$ for $x\in M$.
Note also that $q$ is a projection such that $Jq=pJp=qJ$.
Consider a surjective linear map $pMp\to qMq:pxp\mapsto p'pxpp'=qxq$.
It is well-defined because $pxp=0$ implies $qxq=p'pxpp'=0$, and is a $*$-homomorphism because
\[q(px_1p)(px_2p)q=qx_1px_2q=qx_1qx_2q=(qx_1q)(qx_2q),\qquad x_1,x_2\in M.\]
It is also injective since if $qxq=0$, then
\[p=Jp'J\le Jz(p')J=z(p')^*=z(p')\]
implies $pH\subset z(p')H=\bar{M'p'H}$ and
\[pxpH\subset\bar{pxpM'p'H}=\bar{M'pxpp'H}=\bar{M'qxqH}=0,\qquad x\in M.\]
Therefore, $pMp\to qMq$ is a $*$-isomorphism, hence $q\ne0$ if and only if $p\ne0$.

We can check that $qJq$ is an anti-linear isometric involution on $qH$ by $J(qH)=q(JH)=qH$ and $(qJq)^2=q$, and $qP$ is a self-dual cone by $qP=pp'P\subset P=P^\circ\subset(qP)^\circ$ and conversely the inequality $\<q\xi,\eta\>=\<q\xi,q\eta\>\ge0$ for any $\eta\in P$ implies $q\xi\in P^\circ=P$ and $q\xi\in qP$ whenever $q\xi\in(qP)^\circ$.
The first condition follows from
\[(qJq)(qMq)(qJq)=qJMJq=qM'q=q(p'M'p')q=q(p'Mp')'q=(qMq)',\]
and the second condition follows because $Z(qMq)=qMq\cap(qMq)'=qMq\cap qM'q=qZ(M)q$ so that an element of $Z(qMq)$ is equal to $qzq$ for some $z\in Z(M)$, we have
\[(qJq)(qzq)(qJq)=qJzJq=qz^*q=(qzq)^*,\qquad qzq\in Z(qMq).\]
Since the third and forth axioms for standard forms are clear.

$\Aut(M)$ and the set of unitaries preserving standard form are not homeomorphic! (Takesaki seems to be wrong)
But on locally compact subgroups, the topologies are same.
For example,
If $\alpha:G\to\Aut(M)$ is $\sigma$-weakly continuous, then $\alpha^*:G\to\Aut(M_*)$ is weakly continuous.
By smearing argument on $G$, we can see $\alpha^*:G\to\Aut(M_*)$ is strongly continuous.
Inserting the homeomorphism $P\cong M_*^+$, we have strongly continuous unitary representation on $H$.

\section{Commutative von Neumann algebras}
\subsection{}

\begin{prb}
For a normal weight $\f$ of a commutative von Neumanna algebra $M$, $\f$ is semi-finite if and only if for every projection $p\in M$ with $\f(p)=\infty$, there is another projection $q\in M$ such that $q\le p$ and $0<\f(q)<\infty$.
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
($\Rightarrow$)
Take $e\in M^+$ such that $0<\f(ep)<\infty$.
Approximate $ep$ from below by the simple functions $s=\sum_ia_ip_i$ such that $0<\f(ep)-\e<\f(s)\le\f(ep)<\infty$ by the normality, where $a_i\ge0$ and $p_i$ are mutually orthogonal.
Then, $q:=\sum_ip_i$ satisfies the property.

($\Leftarrow$)
Suppose $\fm$ is not $\sigma$-weakly dense in $M$.
Its $\sigma$-weak closure is given by $pMp$ for some projection $p\in M$.
Then, $1-p$ is a counterexample of the contradictory assumption.
\end{pf}



Monotone convergence theorem states that a measure on a countably decomposable(?) enhanced measurable space $X$ uniquely defines a `countably' normal weight on the space of all measurable functions.
Note that a `countably' normal weight is normal on a countably decomposable von Neumann algebra.


separable commutative von Neumann algebra is generated by one self-adjoint element.

\begin{prb}[semi-finite lower semi-continuous weights]
Let $\Omega$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between semi-finite lower semi-continuous weights of $C_0(\Omega)$ and positive linear functionals on $C_c(\Omega)$.

A semi-finite lower semi-continuous weight on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ is uniquely extended to a semi-finite normal weight on $A^{**}$, and to $\pi(A)''$, where $\pi$ is the semi-cyclic representation.
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
Let $\f$ be a positive linear functional on $C_c(\Omega)$.
We can extend it to $\f:C_0(\Omega)^+\to[0,\infty]$ by letting
\[\f(f):=\sup\{\f(g):g\le f,\ g\in C_c(\Omega)\}.\]
Since $C_0(\Omega)\cap L^1(\f)$ is dense in $C_0(\Omega)$ by compact truncation, $\f$ is semi-finite.
If $f_n\in C_0(\Omega)$ such that $\int|f_n|\le1$ and $f_n\to f$ uniformly, then taking compact $K\subset\Omega$ such that $\int_{K^c}|f|<\e$, we can prove $\int|f|\le1$, so $\f$ is lower semi-continuous.
By taking the restriction on $C_c(\Omega)$, we can reconstrcut the original linear functional.

Conversely, let $\f$ be a semi-finite lower semi-continuous weight on $C_0(\Omega)$.
If there is a point $\omega\in\Omega$ such that $\f(f)=\infty$ whenever $f\in C_0(\Omega)^+$ and $f(\omega)>0$, then $\fm\subset C_0(\Omega\setminus\{\omega\})$, which contradicts to the assumption that $\f$ is semi-finite.
Then, using compactness, we can prove $C_c(\Omega)\subset\fm$.
Now we can check $\f(f)=\sup\{\f(g):g\le f,\ g\in C_c(\Omega)\}$ by constructing an increasing net in $C_c(\Omega)$ that converges to $f$ uniformly.

A \emph{frame} is a partially ordered set $F$ that admits a finite meets and arbitrary joins, and for any $a\in F$ the map $F\to F:x\mapsto x\wedge a$ preserves suprema.
A \emph{locale} is an object of the opposite category of frames.
An element of a locale is called \emph{open}.


A locale is called \emph{coherent} if the set of compact opens is closed under finite meets and every open is the join of compact opens, i.e.~generates opens.
It is known that a coherent locale is spatial.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $X$ is a coherent space.
\item $X$ is a (compact) sober space such that the set of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a base.
\item $X$ is homeomorphic to the underlying space of an affine scheme.
\end{enumerate}
A morphism of $\mathrm{CohLoc}$ is a compact open preserving local morphism.
A morphism of $\mathrm{DistLat}$ is just a lattice morphism.
We can consider the compact open functor $\mathrm{CohLoc}\to\mathrm{DistLat}^{\mathrm{op}}$ and the ideal functor $\mathrm{DistLat}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathrm{CohLoc}$.
They form a categorical equivalence between the category of coherent locales and the opposite category of distributive lattices with lattice morphisms (i.e.~preserving finite meets and joins).

A locale is called \emph{Stone} if it is a coherent locale in which every open is the join of all subopens of it.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $X$ is a Stone space.
\item $X$ is totally disconnected and compact Hausdorff.
\item $X$ is a compact zero-dimesional sober space.
\item $X$ is a compact zero-dimesional Hausdorff space.
\item $X$ is coherent and Hausdorff.

A morphism of $\mathrm{BoolLat}$ is just a lattice morphism.





A locale is called \emph{Stonean} if it is a Stone locale in which the (unique) complement of any element is clopen.
A morphism of $\mathrm{StoneanLoc}$ is an open locale morphism.
A morphism of $\mathrm{CpltBoolLat}$ is a continuous lattice morphism.

A locale is called \emph{Hyperstonean} if...
A boolean lattice is called \emph{localizable} if it is complete, and the identity is approximated by elements admitting a faithful continuous valuation on their compression.
The category $\mathrm{LBAlg}$ admits small products, and the products are preserved by the forgetful functor $\mathrm{LBAlg}\to\mathrm{BAlg}$.

Let $L$ be a measurable locale.
For $\F\in\{\R,\C\}$, define $L^\infty(L,\F)$ to be the set of all bounded localic maps $x:L\to\F$, which are given by the opposite of lattice homomorphism $x^{-1}:\mathrm{top}(\F)\to L$ which preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins, and factors an open ball of $\F$.
We can define a normed $*$-algebra structure on $L^\infty(L,\F)$ such that
\begin{gather*}
(x+y)^{-1}(U):=\bigvee_{U_x+U_y\subset U}(x^{-1}(U_x)\wedge y^{-1}(U_y)),\qquad(xy)^{-1}(U):=\bigvee_{U_xU_y\subset U}(x^{-1}(U_x)\wedge y^{-1}(U_y)),\\
(x^*)^{-1}(U):=x^{-1}(\{\bar z:z\in U\}),\qquad\|x\|=\inf\{\sup_{z\in U}|z|:x^{-1}(U)=1\in L\}.
\end{gather*}
Using the axioms of locales, for example that the meet with a single element preserves arbitrary joins, we can manually check that $L^\infty(L,\F)$ is a commutative normed $*$-algebra, and in particular the C$^*$-identity when $\F=\C$.
Furthermore, since $L^\infty(L,\C)$ is the complexification of $L^\infty(L,\R)$, if we prove $L^\infty(L,\R)$ has a predual, then the completeness with respect to norm follows automatically, so $L^\infty(L,\C)$ becomes a C$^*$-algebra with a predual, i.e.~a von Neumann algebra.

Define $L^1(L,\R)$ the real linear span of continuous valuations on $L$, equipped with the variation norm.
Recall that a continuous valuation is a monotone function $v:L\to[0,\infty)$ such that $v(0)=0$ and $v(p)+v(q)=v(p\vee q)+v(p\wedge q)$, which preserves directed suprema.

\begin{prb}[Maharam classification]
Let $\cA$ be an localizable measurable algebra.
A \emph{Maharam type} or just a \emph{type} of $\cA$ is the smallest cardinal $\tau(\cA)$ of any dense subset of $\cA$.
If $\tau(\cA)=\tau(\cA\wedge a)$ for all non-zero $a\in\cA$, then we say $\cA$ is \emph{Maharam homogeneous}.
For an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the \emph{Maharam component} of type $\kappa$ is the supremum $e_\kappa$ of any non-zero elements $a\in\cA$ such that $A\wedge a$ is Maharam homogeneous of type $\kappa$.

A \emph{cellularity} of a Boolean algebra $\cA$ is the supremum $c(\cA)$ of the cardinalities of any disjoint subset of $\cA\setminus\{0\}$.
Note that the cellularity is either zero or infinite if $\cA$ is atomless, and $\cA\wedge e_\kappa$ is atomless if $\kappa$ is infinite.
We define a cellularity function $c:\mathrm{InfCard}\to\mathrm{InfCard}\cup\{0\}$ such that $c(\kappa):=c(\cA\wedge e_\kappa)$.

\begin{parts}
\item 
\item All Maharam homogeneous probability algebras of same type are isomorphic.
\item A measure algebra $(\cB_\kappa,\mu)$ from the measure space $(\{0,1\}^\kappa,\mu)$ is Maharam homogeneous probability algebra of type $\kappa$.
\item A

\end{prb}



A disjoint union and product of localizable measurable algebras is passed to the direct product and the tensor product.
Every commutative von neumann algebra can be realized as $L^\infty$ of the disjoint union, or equivalently, the direct product of $L^\infty$, of countably decomposable enhanced measurable spaces $\{0,1\}^\kappa$.
Every countably decomposable commutative von Neumann algebra is the tensor product of $\ell^\infty$'s.

The invariants of localizable measure algebras:
\[m:\mathrm{InfCard}\to\mathrm{Card},\qquad n:(0,\infty)\to\mathrm{Card}.\]

The invariants of localizable measurable algebras:
\[c:\mathrm{InfCard}\to\mathrm{InfCard}\cup\{0\},\qquad a\in\mathrm{Card},\]
where
\[c(\kappa):=\begin{cases}\omega&,0<m(\kappa)<\infty\\m(\kappa)&,\text{ otherwise}\end{cases},\qquad a:=\sum_{r\in(0,\infty)}n(r).\]

We have $m(\kappa)\le c(\kappa)$ and $m(\kappa)<c(\kappa)$ only if $c(\kappa)=\omega$.

For an atomless commutative von Neumann algebra $M$ (no minimal projections), countable decomposability says that there is a countable collection of cardinals $S$ such that $c(\kappa)=\omega$ if $\kappa\in S$ and $c(\kappa)=0$, i.e.~the countable product of $L^\infty(\{0,1\}^\kappa)$, and separability says that $c(\omega)=\omega$ and $c(\kappa)=0$ for $\kappa>\omega$, i.e.~$L^\infty(\{0,1\}^\omega)$.

\subsection{Spectral theory}
Spectral theory = representation theory of commutative operator algebras

\begin{prb}
Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space and $\pi:C_0(X)\to B(H)$ be a representation.
Then, we have $\pi(C_0(X))\subset\pi(C_0(X))'$.

A \emph{multiplication representation} of $C_0(X)$ refers to nothing but the associated semi-cyclic representation of some Radon measure of $C_0(X)$.
If the Radon measure is finite, then the multiplication representation would be cyclic.
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
Let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on $X$ and $m:C_0(X)\to B(L^2(\mu))$ be the multiplication representation.
The representation $m$ is normally extended to $L^\infty(\mu)$ such that $m(L^\infty(\mu))=m(C_0(X))''$, and we have $L^1(\mu)\cong L^\infty(\mu)_*$.
The semi-cyclic data $\Lambda$ is given by the identity on $\dom\Lambda=L^2(\mu)\cap L^\infty(\mu)$.
Since $(m(C_0(X))')_1^+$ each defines a semi-finite normal weight $\f\le\mu$, which gives $L^\infty(\mu)_1^+$, we have $m(C_0(X))'=L^\infty(\mu)=m(C_0(X))''$. (In other words, we use the two versions of Radon-Nikodym, commutant and centralizer.)
Therefore, $L^\infty(\mu)$ is maximal abelian subalgebra of $B(L^2(\mu))$.

\section{Tensor products and direct integrals}


\begin{prb}
Let $M$ and $N$ be von Neumann algebras.
Consider the embedding $M_*\odot N_*\subset(M\otimes_{\min}N)^*$.
The closure $M_*\bar\otimes N_*$ is invariant under $M\otimes_{\min}N$, so it defines a von Neumann subalgebra of $(M\otimes_{\min}N)^{**}$ by a central projection.
This is the tensor product von Neumann algebra of $M$ and $N$.
\end{prb}


\begin{prb}[Dixmier's measurable fields]
Let $(X,\mu)$ be a localizable measure space.
Suppose $\{H_s\}_{s\in X}$ is a family of Hilbert spaces, and define $F:=\prod_{s\in X}H_s$ the section space.
We say $\{H_s\}_{s\in X}$ is \emph{measurable} if $F$ has a linear subspace $S$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $s\mapsto\|\xi_s\|$ is measurable for $\xi\in S$,
\item for $\eta\in F$ if $s\mapsto\<\xi_s,\eta_s\>$ is measurable for all $\xi\in S$, then $\eta\in S$,
\item There is a sequence of $\xi_n$ in $S$ such that for each $s\in X$ the linear span $\xi_{n,s}$ is dense in $H_s$.
\end{enumerate}
An element of $S$ is called a \emph{measurable vector field}.
For a measurable vector field $\xi$, we say it is \emph{square-integrable} if $\int\|\xi_s\|^2\,d\mu(s)<\infty$.
The space of square-integrable vector fields has a natural sesquilinear form, which gives rise to a Hilbert space by separation without completion.
The obtained Hilbert space is called the \emph{direct integral} of the field $\{H_s\}_{s\in X}$ of Hilbert spaces.



A field of bounded linear operators $\{T_s\}_{s\in X}$ is called \emph{measurable} if it sends a measurable vector field to a measurable vector field.

An operator $T$ in $B(H)$ is called \emph{decomposable} if it is represented by a measurable field of bounded linear operators.
A decomposable operator is called \emph{diagonalizable} if it is represented by an element of $L^\infty(\mu)$.


\end{prb}


A \emph{measurable field of Hilbert spaces} is a faithful unital normal representation of a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a faithful semi-finite normal weight, i.e.~$L^\infty(\mu)\subset B(H)$.
An operator $T\in B(H)$ is called \emph{diagonal} if $T\in L^\infty(\mu)$, and called \emph{decomposable} if $T\in L^\infty(\mu)'$.

For a von Neumann algebra $M$, $M^{sa}$ is a conditionally monotone complete poset, and $P(M)$ is a complete orthomodular lattice.
For a commutative von Neumann algebra $M$, $M^{sa}$ is a Dedekind complete Banach lattice, and $P(M)$ is a complete Boolean lattice.

For von Neumann algebras, we want to compare order topology, measure topology, and operator topologies.

For a type II von Neumann algebra, it is called of \emph{type II$_1$} if it is finite, and of \emph{type II$_\infty$} if it has no central finite projections.

Also, Murray and von Neumann showed there is a unique finite tracial state and the set of traces of projections is $[0,1]$.
Examples of II$_1$ factors include crossed product, tensor product, free product, ultraproduct.
Free probability theory attacks the free groups factors, which are type II$_1$.

Given a faithful semi-finite normal weight $\f$ on $M$, we can define an inner product on $C_c(G,M)$, which gives rise to a left Hilbert algebra.
The associated left von Neumann algebra is equal to the crossed product $G\ltimes_\alpha M$.
