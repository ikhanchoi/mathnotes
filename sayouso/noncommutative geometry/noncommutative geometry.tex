A wave function is a section $\psi$ of a $\rU(1)$-line bundle $\cL\to M$, more generally, a section $\psi$ of a Hermitian $G$-vector bundle $\cV\to M$.
Galilean invariant momentum operator?
We fix a connection $\nabla$ on $\cV$, which can be forgotten if $M$ is contractible and no magnetic fields are considered.
A $\rU(N)$-gauge fixing is just a choice of a local field of orthonormal frames on the intersection of two charts of $M$, making $\cV$ locally trivially $\C^N$ with the standard basis.
After gauge fixing, the covariant derivative is represented locally as $\nabla_j\psi=(\partial_j-iA_j)\psi$, where $A=\sum_jA_jdx^j$ is a $\R=-i\fu(1)$-valued one-form.

The connection $\nabla$ is independent
If $M$ has non-trivial holonomy (the Aharonov-Bohm flux), then it comes into play.


On $M=\R^2$ with a connection $\nabla$ such that the curvature form is $\cF^\nabla=b\cdot\vol_M$ for some $b\in\R\setminus\{0\}$, then the \emph{Landau operator}, which is a free Hamiltonian defined by the connection Laplacian or the Bochner Laplacian $H:=\nabla^*\nabla=-\tr(\nabla^2)\ge0$, its spectrum is known to be $\sigma(H)=(2\N+1)|b|$.
This discreteness of the spectrum is called the \emph{Landau quantization}.


We consider a spin manifold $M$ with the spinor bundle $\cS$, and the sections of $\cS\otimes\cV\to M$ represent the space of wave functions.
