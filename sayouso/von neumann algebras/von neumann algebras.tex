\section{}
Existence of range projections(=left support projection).
A projection $p\in M$ is called the \emph{range} projection of $x\in M$ if $x^*yx=0$ if and only if $p^*yp=0$ for every $y\in M$
\begin{pf}
(Existence)
Let $x\in M$.
Since $\im x=\im(xx^*)^{\frac12}$, we may assume $0\le x\le1$.
Then, $x^{2^{-n}}$ is an increasing sequence in $M$ bounded by one, so it converges strongly to some $p\in M_+$.
We can check $p^2=p$ by...
We can check $p$ is the range projection of $x$ by...
\end{pf}

\begin{prb}[Polar decomposition]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra and let $x\in M$.
Let $p$ and $q$ be the range projections of $x$ and $|x|$ respectively.
Then, there is $v\in M$ such that
\begin{parts}
\item $x=v|x|$ and $v=vq$,
\item $q=v^*v$ and $|x|=v^*x$,
\item $v^*=v^*p$
\item $p=vv^*$.
\item $q$ is the range projection of $x^*$.
\item $x^*=v^*|x^*|$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
Since $x^*x\le|x|^*|x|$, there is a unique $v\in M$ such that $x=v|x|$ and $v=vq$.

(b)
Then,
\[q-v^*v=q(1-v^*v)q=0\]
since
\[|x|(1-v^*v)|x|=|x|^2-|x|^2=0\]
So we have
\[|x|=q|x|=v^*v|x|=v^*x.\]

(c)
Also,
\[|(1-p)v|^2=q(1-v^*pv)q=0\]
since
\[|x|(1-v^*pv)|x|=|x|^2-|x|^2=0.\]
Thus $v=pv$.

(d)
Now,
\[p-vv^*=p(1-vv^*)p=0\]
since
\[x^*(1-vv^*)x=|x|^2-|x|^2=0.\]

(e)
We have
\[xyx^*=0\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad |x|y|x|=0.\]
Therefore, $q$ is the range projection of $x^*$, and the right support projection of $x$.

\bigskip
Type I factors.
It possess a minimal projection.
It is isomorphic to the whole $B(H)$ for some Hilbert space.
Therefore, it is classified by the cardinality of $H$.

Type II factors.
No minimal projection, but there are non-zero finite projections so that every projection can be ``halved'' by two Murray-von Neumann equivalent projections.

In type II$_1$ factors, the identity is a finite projection
Also, Murray and von Neumann showed there is a unique finite tracial state and the set of traces of projections is $[0,1]$.
Examples of II$_1$ factors include crossed product, tensor product, free product, ultraproduct.
Free probability theory attacks the free groups factors, which are type II$_1$.

In type II$_\infty$ factors.
There is a unique semifinite tracial state up to rescaling and the set of traces of projections is $[0,\infty]$.

In type III factors no non-zero finite projections exists.
Classified the $\lambda\in[0,1]$ appeared in its Connes spectrum, they are denoted by III$_\lambda$.
Tomita-Takesaki theory.
It is represented as the crossed product of a type II$_\infty$ factor and $\R$.

Amenability, equivalently hyperfiniteness is a very nice condition in von Neumann algebra theory.
Group-measure space construction can construct them.
There are unique hyperfinite type II$_1$ and II$_\infty$ factors, and their property is well-known.
Fundamental groups of type II factors, discrete group theory, Kazhdan's property (T) are used.

Tensor product factors such as Araki-Woods factors and Powers factors.





\section{Commutative von Neumann algebras}

\begin{prb}[Enhanced measurable spaces]
An \emph{enhanced measurable space} is a measurable space $(X,M)$ together with a $\sigma$-ideal $N$ of $M$.
A morphism between enhanced measurable spaces is a partial function $f:X_1\to X_2$ on a conegligible set such that $f^*$ induces a ring homomorphism $M_2/N_2\to M_1/N_1$.
\begin{parts}
\item Maharam's theoem: every enhanced measurable space is isomorphic to the disjoint union of $\{0,1\}^I$, where $I$ is an aribitrary cardinality...?
\item A $\sigma$-finite enhanced measurable space is isomorphic to a enhenced measurable space induced from a standard probability space...?
\item For $\sigma$-finite enhanced measurable spaces, a $*$-homomorphism $L^\infty(X_2)\to L^\infty(X_1)$ induces a morphism $X_1\to X_2$...?
\end{parts}
\end{prb}

\begin{prb}
Noncommutative $L^p$ spaces for a general weight?
\begin{parts}
\item For $1\le p<\infty$, $C_0(X)\to L^p(X,\mu)$ is a bounded linear maps of dense range.
\item $L^\infty(X,\mu)$ is a m.a.s.a.~of $B(L^2(X,\mu))$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
We will show bounded linear maps $L^\infty(X,\mu)'\to M(X)$ and $L^\infty(X,\mu)\to M(X)$ have the same image.
Let $y\in L^\infty(X,\mu)'$ and define $\mu_y\in M(X)$ by
\[\mu_y(a):=\<\pi_\mu(a)y\psi_\mu,\psi_\mu\>.\]
We claim that $\mu_y$ factors through $L^1(X,\mu)$.
\end{pf}

Monotone convergence theorem states that a measure on a countably decomposable(?) enhanced measurable space $X$ uniquely defines a `countably' normal weight on the space of all measurable functions.
Note that a `countably' normal weight is normal on a countably decomposable von Neumann algebra.



\begin{prb}[Maximal commutative subalgebras]
A commutative von Neumann algebra $M$ is m.a.s.a.~if and only if it admits a cyclic vector.
In this case, $M$ is spatially isomorphic to some $L^\infty$(if separable?).
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
\end{pf}

separable commutative von Neumann algebra is generated by one self-adjoint element.

\section{Normal weights}

\begin{prb}[Cyclic and separating vectors]
\end{prb}

A vector state is separating iff it is faithful.

If $M\subset B(H)$ admits a separating vector, then every normal state is a vector state. (T:V.1.12, J:7.1.4?)



\begin{prb}[Countably decomposable von Neumann algebras]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
A projection $p\in M$ is called \emph{countably decomposable} if mutually orthogonal nonzero projections majorized by $p$ are at most countable, and we say $M$ is \emph{countably decomposable} if the identity is.
The followings are all equivalent.
\begin{parts}
\item $M$ is countably decomposable.
\item $M$ admits a faithful normal state.
\item $M$ admits a  with a cyclic and separating vector.
\item The unit ball of $M$ is metrizable in strong topology.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}


\end{pf}

\begin{prb}[Separable predual]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
The followings are all equivalent.
\begin{parts}
\item $M$ has the separable predual.
\item $M$ faithfully acts on a separable Hilbert space.
\item $M$ is countably decomposable and countably generated.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}

\begin{prb}[Ideals associated to weights]
left ideal, definition ideal
\end{prb}


\begin{prb}[Semi-cyclic representations]
Let $A$ be a C$^*$-algebra.
A \emph{semi-cyclic representation} is a representation $\pi:A\to B(H)$ together with a linear map $\psi:\fn\to H$ from a left ideal $\fn$ of $A$ into $H$ with dense range, such that $\pi(x)\psi(y)=\psi(xy)$ for $x\in A$ and $y\in\fn$.

For a semi-cyclic representation, if we denote $\fm:=\fn^*\fn$, then we have a bilinear form
\[\Theta:\fm\times\pi(A)'\to\C:(y^*x,z)\mapsto\<z\psi(x),\psi(y)\>.\]
With this, we can construct a linear map $\theta:\fm\to(\pi(A)')_*$ and its transpose $\theta^*:\pi(A)'\to\fm^\#$.

Consider a weight $\f$.
\begin{parts}
\item A (it might require some condition here if $A$ is not W$^*$) weight on $A$ defines a semi-cyclic representation and vice versa?
\item If $A=M$ is a von Neumann algebra, then we can let $\theta_*:\pi(M)'\to M_*$ to have $\theta^{**}=\theta$.
\item $\theta^*$ is bijective onto the space of linear functionals on $\fm$ absolutely continuous with respect to $\f$. (bounded Radon-Nikodym)
\item 
\end{parts}
\end{prb}



\begin{prb}[Normal weights]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
Let $\omega$ be a weight of $M$.
\begin{parts}
\item $\omega$ is normal.
\item $\omega$ is $\sigma$-weakly lower semi-continuous.
\item $\omega$ is the pointwise supremum of some set of normal positive linear functionals.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(c)$\Rightarrow$(b)$\Rightarrow$(a) are clear.

(a)$\Rightarrow$(b)


Suppose first $M$ is countably decomposable so that $B$ is metrizable.




\end{pf}

If we let $M_0$ be the union of all countably decomposable $\sigma$-weakly closed ideals of $M$, then $M_0$ is a $\sigma$-weakly sequentially closed ideal of $M$.

If $M$ is countably decomposable, then every bounded increasing net has a bounded increasing subsequence of same supremum.





\section{Hilbert algebras}



\begin{prb}
A \emph{left Hilbert algebra} is a $*$-algebra $A$ together with an inner product such that the left multiplication defines a nondegenerate $*$-homomorphism $\lambda:A\to B(H)$, where $H:=\bar A$, and the involution is a closable antilinear operator whose domain contains $A$.

If an involution is an isometry, then it is also a right Hilbert algebra, which is the unimodular case.

\end{prb}

For a locally compact group $G$, $A=C_c(G)$ together with a left Haar measure on $G$ is a left Hilbert algebra with
\[(\xi\eta)(s):=\int_G\xi(t)\eta(t^{-1}s)\,dt,\]
\[\<\xi,\eta\>:=\int\bar{\eta(s)}\xi(s)\,ds.\]
\[S\xi(s):=\Delta(s^{-1})\bar{\xi(s^{-1})},\qquad F\xi(s)=\bar{\xi(s^{-1})},\]
\[\Delta\xi(s)=\Delta(s)\xi(s),\qquad J\xi(s)=\Delta(s)^{-\frac12}\bar{\xi(s^{-1})},\]

\[\<S\xi,\eta\>=\<F\eta,\xi\>\]

Define $\Delta:=(CS)^*(CS)$, $J:=S\Delta^{\frac12}$.
What are the domains of $S^{-1}$ and $S^*$? polar decomposition?
Relation between $L^1(G,d\lambda)$ and $L^1(G,d\rho)$?
What is $C_c(G)'$?



Goal: $\Delta^{it}R_l(A)\Delta^{-it}=R_l(A)$ and $JR_l(A)J=R_l(A)'$.







For a weight $\f$, we have a faithful semi-cyclic representation $(\pi,\psi)$.
The map $\pi:M\to B(H)$ is always unital.

The faithfulness of $\f$ is equivalent to the faithfulness of $\pi$.
Define
$A:=\psi(\fn\cap\fn^*)\subset H$, $\psi(x)\psi(y):=\psi(xy)$, $\psi(x)^*:=\psi(x)$, $\lambda(\psi(x)):=\pi(x)$.

For a projection, $p\in\fn\cap\fn^*$, $p\in\fm^+$, $\f(p)<\infty$ are all equivalent.
If $\f$ is semi-finite, then there is an increasing net of projections $p_\alpha$ in $\fn\cap\fn^*$ converges $\sigma$-strongly to the identity of $M$.
It implies that $\lambda$ is non-degenerate.
It also implies, $\psi(p_\alpha x)=\pi(p_\alpha)\psi(x)\to\psi(x)$ and $p_\alpha x\in fn^*$ implies that $\psi(\fn\cap\fn^*)$ is dense in $\psi(\fn)$, i.e.~$A$ is dense in $H$.
I do not know how to deduce the density of $A$ in $H$ without semi-finiteness.



\section{Traces}

\begin{prb}[Semi-finite and tracial von Neumann algebras]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
We say $M$ is \emph{semi-finite} if it admits a faithful normal semi-finite trace, and \emph{tracial} if it admits a faithful normal tracial state.
\begin{parts}
\item regular representation and antilinear isometric involution $J$. $L(G)=\rho(G)'$
\item $M$ is semi-finite if and only if type III does not occur in the direct sum.

\item A factor $M$ has at most one tracial state, which is normal and faithful.
\item A factor is tracial if and only if it is type II$_1$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}



\begin{prb}[Semi-finite traces]

For a trace $\tau$
\begin{parts}
\item $\tau$ is semi-finite if and only if $x\in M^+$ has a net $x_\alpha\in L^1(M,\tau)^+$ such that $x_\alpha\uparrow x$ strongly.
\item Let $\tau$ be normal and faithful. Then, $\tau$ is semi-finite if and only if
\[\tau(x)=\sup\{\,\tau(y):y\le x,\ y\in L^1(M,\tau)^+\,\}\quad\text{ for }\quad x\in M^+.\]

\begin{prb}
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra.
Since every $\sigma$-weakly closed ideal of $M$ admits a unit $z$ so that we have $zM,Mz\subset I\subset zIz\subset zMz$, and it implies $z$ is a central projection of $M$.
A von Neumann algebra $M$ on $H$ is called a \emph{factor} if $M\cap M'=\C\id_H$, which is equivalent to that there are only two $\sigma$-weakly closed ideals of $M$.
In a factor, every ideal of $M$ is $\sigma$-weakly dense in $M$
