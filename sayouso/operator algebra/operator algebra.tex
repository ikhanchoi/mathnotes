\section{Multiplier algebra}

\begin{prb}[Multiplier algebra]
Let $\cA$ be a C$^*$-algebra.
A \emph{double centralizer} of $\cA$ is a pair $(L,R)$ of bounded linear maps on $\cA$ such that $aL(b)=R(a)b$ for all $a,b\in\cA$.
The \emph{multiplier algebra} $M(\cA)$ of $\cA$ is defined to be the set of all double centralizers of $\cA$.

\item Hilbert C$^*$-module description
\end{parts}
\end{prb}

\begin{prb}[Examples of multiplier algebras]
\begin{parts}
\item $M(K(H))\cong B(H)$.
\item $M(C_0(\Omega))\cong C_b(\Omega)$.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
(a)

(b)
First we claim $C_0(\Omega)$ is an essential ideal of $C_b(\Omega)$.
Since $C_b(\Omega)\cong C(\beta\Omega)$, and since closed ideals of $C(\beta\Omega)$ are corresponded to open subsets of $\beta\Omega$, $C_0(\Omega)\cap J$ is not trivial for every closed ideal $J$ of $C_b(\Omega)$.

Now we have an injective $^*$-homomorphism $C_b(\Omega)\to M(C_0(\Omega))$, for which we want to show the surjectivity.
Let $g\in M(C_0(\Omega))^+$.

\section*{Exercises}
\begin{prb}
Let $\cB$ be a hereditary C$^*$-subalgebra of a C$^*$-algebra $\cA$.
Let $a\in\cA^+$.
If for any $\e>0$ there is $b\in\cB^+$ such that $a-\e\le b$, then $a\in B^+$.
\end{prb}
\begin{pf}
To catch the idea, suppose $\cA$ is abelian.
We want to approximate $a$ by the elements of $\cB$ in norm.
To do this, for each $\e>0$, we want to construct $b'\in\cB^+$ such that $a-\e\le b'\le a+\e$ using $b$.
Taking $b'=\min\{a,b\}$ is impossible in non-abelian case, but we can put $b'=\frac a{b+\e}b$.
For a simpler proof, $b'=(\frac{\sqrt{ab}}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e})^2$ is a better choice.

Define
\[b':=\frac{\sqrt b}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}a\frac{\sqrt b}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}.\]
Then,
\[\|\sqrt a-\sqrt a\frac{\sqrt b}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}\|^2=\|\frac{\sqrt\e}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}a\frac{\sqrt\e}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}\|\le\e\]
implies
\[\lim_{\e\to0}b'=\lim_{\e\to0}\frac{\sqrt b}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}\sqrt a\cdot\sqrt a\frac{\sqrt b}{\sqrt b+\sqrt\e}=\sqrt a\cdot\sqrt a=a.\]

Every trace of factor is faithful

\begin{prb}
Normal states is a state in which the monotone convergence theorem holds.
Precisely, a state $\rho$ is \emph{normal} if a monotone net $a_\alpha$ strongly converges to $a$ then $\rho(a_\alpha)\to\rho(a)$.

\begin{prb}[Semi-finite traces]
Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra and $\tau$ is a trace.
For a trace $\tau$
\begin{parts}
\item $\tau$ is semi-finite if and only if $x\in M^+$ has a net $x_\alpha\in L^1(M,\tau)^+$ such that $x_\alpha\uparrow x$ strongly.
\item Let $\tau$ be normal and faithful. Then, $\tau$ is semi-finite if and only if
\[\tau(x)=\sup\{\,\tau(y):y\le x,\ y\in L^1(M,\tau)^+\,\}\quad\text{ for }\quad x\in M^+.\]

Direct integral of factors.

Type I factors.
It possess a minimal projection.
It is isomorphic to the whole $B(H)$ for some Hilbert space.
Therefore, it is classified by the cardinality of $H$.

Type II factors.
No minimal projection, but there are non-zero finite projections so that every projection can be ``halved'' by two Murray-von Neumann equivalent projections.

In type II$_1$ factors, the identity is a finite projection
Also, Murray and von Neumann showed there is a unique finite tracial state and the set of traces of projections is $[0,1]$.
Free probability theory attacks the free groups factors, which are type II$_1$.

In type II$_\infty$ factors
There is a unique semifinite tracial state up to rescaling and the set of traces of projections is $[0,\infty]$.

In type III factors no non-zero finite projections exists.
Classified the $\lambda\in[0,1]$ appeared in its Connes spectrum, they are denoted by III$_\lambda$.
Tomita-Takesaki theory.
It is represented as the crossed product of a type II$_\infty$ factor and $\R$.

Amenability, equivalently hyperfiniteness is a very nice condition in von Neumann algebra theory.
Group-measure space construction can construct them.
There are unique hyperfinite type II$_1$ and II$_\infty$ factors, and their property is well-known.
Fundamental groups of type II factors, discrete group theory, Kazhdan's property (T) are used.


Tensor product facctors such as Araki-Woods factors and Powers factors.
