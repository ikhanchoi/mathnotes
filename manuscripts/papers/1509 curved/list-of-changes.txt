
Thanks for the comments. I have revised the manuscript accordingly. 


The change I made for Comment 2 seems need more explanation. 

I redefined "conical origami" by adding a condition that the domain is restricted 
to $\Bbb{R}^2$ from any connected set $\Omega$. Then, the problem vanishes by defining "conical origami" as a map whose image is 'a cone', not 'CONTAINED IN a cone'.
The half-lines lying on the cone are guaranted to be fully contained in $\im u$.

< For a connected set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, if a map $f \colon \Omega\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is piecewise $C^1$, of course, then $f$ is almost everywhere differentiable.
< The \emph{singular set} $\Sigma_f\subset\Omega$ of the map $f$ refers to the set of points  at which $f$ is not differentiable.
< The singular set $\Sigma_f$ is closed in $\Omega$ and each arbitrary compact set in $\Omega$ intersects a finite number of connected components of $\Omega\setminus\Sigma_f$.
