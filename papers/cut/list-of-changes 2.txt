
Thanks for the comments. I have revised the manuscript accordingly. 

Honestly, I did not understand what the "1-homogeneous" means at the first comment.
However the second comment let me notice what the problem was.
In the definition of a conical origami, I changed the condition that the image of $u$ is a cone into the 1-homogeneity.

The vertex of the cone should be the origin of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\rho\psi$-plane cannot be the plane $S$.
Therefore, the plane $S$, which was the plane $z=0$ in the first revised manuscript on February 26, is defined to be a set of points whose $z$-coordinates are $-z$.



In what follows is the list of all the changes made to the previously submitted manuscript on February 26.

We call the origami $u$ whose image is a cone a \emph{conical origami} when the domain $\Omega$ of $u$ is taken to be the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^2$.

We define a \emph{conical origami} as a 1-homogeneous origami, that means the equation $u(tv)=tu(v)$ holds for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $v,tv\in\Omega$.
Then, the image of a conical origami should be contained in a cone and the origin of $\mathbb{R}^2$ maps to the vertex of the cone under the conical origami.

If the condition that the image of $u$ is a cone is excluded and the domain $\mathbb{R}^2$ is replaced with any connected set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, then the map $u$ is called just an \emph{origami}.

The altitude of a point $u(\rho\cos\psi,\rho\sin\psi)=u(\rho,\psi)_{polar}$ in cylindrical coordinate is $0$ if and only if $\rho=r(\psi)$, that is, the point $(\rho\cos\psi,\rho\sin\psi)$ is on the curve $\gamma$.
So we get $S\cap\im u=u(\im \gamma)$ where $S$ is the plane $z=0$, and the curve $\gamma$ is a cut on $u$ if $u$ is an origami.

The equality $\partial^2u/\partial\rho^2=0$ implies $u$ is linear in $\rho$.
The image $u(O)$ is $(0,0,z)$ regardless of $\psi$.
It means that the image of $u$ is a cone, not embedded in a plane, because $z>0$.
