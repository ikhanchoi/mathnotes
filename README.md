# Ikhan Choi's mathematics notes

Hi, I am Ikhan Choi.

I am a math-majored student from South Korea.

I am mainly interested in operator algebra:
 * Operator algebra and abstract harmonic analysis, with their applications to mathematical physics.
 * Representation theory regarding symmetries of physical systems.
 * Functional and harmonic analytic techniques applied in other fields of mathematics.
 * Numerical and statistical simulations of some physical phenomena.
