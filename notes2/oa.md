Doplicher-Haag-Roberts theory defines the concept of _tensor product_ of net of algebras by considering composition of endomorphisms between nets of algebras.
The commutativity, up to unitary equivalence, of this tensor product follows from the locality axiom.
It is figured by Longo that the DHR theory has an analogy with subfactor theory of Jones.

A net of algebras on the 1+1 Minkowski space is decomposed as a tensor product of two nets of algebras on the 1-dimensional space, which are called chirl nets.
Due to the disconnectivity of the completion of open sets in 1 dimensional space, the unitary mapping that connects _tensor products_ of nets of algebras brings a braiding; their representations produce a baided tensor category.
