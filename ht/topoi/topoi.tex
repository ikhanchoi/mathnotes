\begin{prb}[Homotopy coherent nerve]
A simplicially enriched category is identified with those simplicial objects in Cat whose face and degeneracy maps are constant on objects and only affect the morphisms.





topological group
-> topologically enriched category
-> simplicially enriched category
-> simplicial object in Cat

So taking the homotopy coherent nerve, we obtain a simplicial set, whose geometric realization is the classifying space.
