Every ring will be commutative and unital if not mentioned.
For a ring $A$, $\Spec A$ is a ringed space defined by the set of all prime ideals of $A$, together with a sheaf of rings.
A subset of $\Spec A$ is defined to be \emph{closed} if it is given by the zero set $\Spec A/\fa=\{\fp\in\Spec A:\fa\subset\fp\}$ for some ideal $\fa\subset A$.
An ideal $\fa$ of $A$ is proper if and only if the corresponding zero set $\Spec A/\fa$ is non-empty.
A \emph{generic} point of a topological space is a point whose closure is the whole space.

\[\Spec\Z=\{(p):p\in\Z\text{ prime}\}\cup\{0\}.\]
\[\Spec\R[x]=\A^1_\R=\{(x-a):a\in\R\}\cup\{(f):f\in\R[x]\text{ irreducible quadratic}\}\cup\{0\}.\]
\[\Spec\Q[x]=\A^1_\Q\]
\[\Spec\F_p[x]=\A^1_{\F_p}=\{(f):f\in\F_p[x]\text{ irreducible}\}\cup\{0\}.\]
\[\Spec\C[x,y]=\A^2_\C=\{(x-a,y-b):(a,b)\in\C^2\}\cup\{(f):f\in\C[x,y]\text{ irreducible}\}\cup\{(0)\}.\]

Nulstellensatz states that the set of closed points of $\A^n_\C$ is exactly $\C^n$.
It connects the theory of classical algebraic geometry to scheme theory.
Zariski lemma, somtimes called the Nullstellensatz, states that for a field $k$ the residue field of a maximal ideal of $k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ is a finite extension of $k$.
In other words, for a field extension $K/k$, $K$ is finitely generated as $k$-modules if $K$ is finitely generated as $k$-algebras.


\begin{prb}[Quotients and localizations]
\end{prb}

For an ideal $\fa\subset A$, the spectrum of the quotient $\Spec A/\fa$ gives a closed subset of $\Spec A$.
For an element $f\in A$, the spectrum of the localization $\Spec A_f$ gives a distinguished open subset of $\Spec A$, which generate a topological base.
For a prime ideal $\fp\subset A$, the spectrum of the localization $\Spec A_\fp$, which is a local ring, gives the set of prime ideals $\Spec A$ containing $\fp$.


\[\Spec\C[x]_x=\Spec\C[x]\setminus\Spec\C[x]/(x)=\{(x-a):a\in\C\setminus\{0\}\}\cup\{(0)\}\]

\[\Spec\C[x]_{(x)}=\{(x)\}\cup\{(0)\}.\]
\[\Spec\C[x,y]_{(x)}=\{(x,y-b):b\in\C\}\cup\{(x)\}\cup\{(0)\}\]
\[\Spec\Z[x]\text{ over }\Spec\Z\]



\begin{prb}[Integral schemes]
Let $X$ be a scheme.
We say $X$ is \emph{reduced} if every stalk is reduced, that is, it has no non-zero nilpotents, i.e.~``A function is zero if it is zero at every point''.
We say $X$ is \emph{irreducible} if every two open subsets intersects.
It is an algebro-geometric analogue of connectedness.
We say $X$ is \emph{integral} if it is non-empty and every non-empty affine open subset is isomorphic to the spectrum of an integral domain.
\begin{parts}
\item A scheme is integral if and only if it is reduced and irreducible.
\item An integral scheme has a unique generic point $\eta$.
\item The stalk $\cO_{X,\eta}$ at the generic point is naturally identified with the field $K(A)$ of fractions, where $\Spec A$ is any non-empty affine open subset of an integral scheme $X$. So, we can define ``rational functions'' on integral schemes.
\end{parts}
\end{prb}

\begin{prb}[Separated schemes]
\emph{quasi-separated} if the intersection of any two quasi-compact open subsets is quasi-compact.
\end{prb}


\begin{prb}[Schemes of finite type]
Let $X$ be a scheme.
We say $X$ is \emph{quasi-compact} if it the Zariski topology is compact, \emph{locally noetherian} if it is covered by the spectrum of noetherian rings, and \emph{locally of finite type} (over a ring $A$) if it is covered by the spectrum of finitely generated algebras (over $A$).
A \emph{notherian} scheme is a quasi-compact locally notherian scheme, and a scheme of \emph{finite type} is a quasi-compact scheme of locally finite type.
\begin{parts}
\item A notherian scheme is automatically quasi-separated.
\item A noetherian scheme is integral if and only if it is non-empty connected and every stalk is an integral domain.
\item A scheme of finite type over a noetherian ring is noetherian.
\end{parts}

\section{Constructions for schemes}



\begin{prb}[Projective schemes]
We say a variety is \emph{projective} if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of $\P^n$ for some $n$.

For a fixed a base ring $A$, let $S$ be a $\Z_{\ge0}$-graded ring such that $S_0=A$, and define the \emph{irrelavent ideal} $S_+:=\bigoplus_{i\ge1}S_i$ of $S$.
The \emph{Proj construction} of $S$ is a scheme $\Proj S$ constructed as follows.
The set $\Proj S$ consists of all homogeneous prime ideals of $S$ not containing $S_+$, the topology is determined by setting $V(\fa):=\{\fp\in\Proj S:\fa\subset\fp\}$ as closed sets where $\fa$ runs through the homogeneous ideals of $S$, and the structure sheaf defined such that $\cO_{\Proj S}(D(f)):=S_{((f))}$ for homogeneous $f\in S_+$, where $S_{(\fp)}:=(S_\fp)_0$ denotes the zeroth graded piece of localized $\Z$-graded rings $S_\fp$, and the set $D(f):=\Proj S\setminus V(f)$ is called a \emph{standard open} of $\Proj S$, which can be shown to be affine.

There is a canonical $\Z$-graded $\cO_{\Proj S}$-modules, of which the graded pieces $\cO(i)$ are line bundles called the \emph{Serre twisting sheaves}.
\end{prb}

A quasi-projective scheme $X$ over $A$ is of finite type of $A$.
If $A$ is furthermore noetherian, then $X$ is noetherian.

\chapter{Curves}


In general, a variety over $k$ is meant by a scheme which is integral, separated, and of finite type.
We wan to classify 
\begin{itemize}
\item Hartshorne: integral scheme of dimension 1 which is proper and regular.
\item Vakil: integral scheme of dimension 1 which is projective and regular.
\end{itemize}
I think they are equivalent to smooth complete curves.

\section{Preliminaries}
Invariants
\begin{itemize}
\item genus: $p_a(X)=p_g(X)=h^1(\cO_X)$
\item Weil vs Cartier divisor groups: $\Cl(X)\cong\Pic(X)$
\end{itemize}

Computation tools
\begin{itemize}
\item $|D|\leftrightarrow PH^0(X,\cL(D))$ so that $|D|$ is identified as a projective space
\item $\Omega_X\cong\omega_X$
\item Riemann-Roch theorem: $l(D)-l(K-D)=\deg D+1-g$
\item Hurwitz theorem: $2g(X)-2=\deg f\cdot(2g(Y)-2)+\deg R$
\end{itemize}


birational iff isomorphic
A morphism $f:X\to Y$ induces a field extension $\cK(X)/\cK(Y)$.

\section{Lower genus}
elliptic: invariants, moduli space, structures
hyperelliptic: 
non-hyperelliptic: canonical embedding


\section{Classification by genus and moduli spaces}
Deligne-Mumford: $\cM_g$ for $g\ge2$ is an irreducible quasi-projective variety of dimension $3g-3$.

\section{Classification by degree in $\P^3$}

A divisor $D$ is called \emph{very ample} if $\cL(D)\cong\cO(1)$ in some closed immersion into a projective space.
A divisor $D$ is called \emph{ample} if $\cF\otimes\cL^n$ is generated by global sections for sufficiently large $n$, for each coherent sheaf $\cF$.
A \emph{linear system} is a projective subspace of some complete linear system $|D|\cong\P^{l(D)-1}$, the set of all effective divisors linearly equivalent to $D$, which is identified to a projective space.
The \emph{base locus} of a linear system $\fd$ is the set $\bigcap_{D\in\delta}\supp D$.
It is known that $|D|$ is base point free if and only if $\cL(D)$ is generated by global sections, and a linear system is base point free if and only if some embedding....?

Any choice of a finite system of non-simultaneously vanishing global sections of a globally generated line bundle defines a morphism to a projective space.
If the line bundle is very ample, then the morphism is an embedding.
